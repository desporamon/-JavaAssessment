###### What did you like about this project?
- Still struggling to complete the assessment.
- Managed to properly appy the concepts of HashMap taught in class - i.e .put .get containsKey, KeySet method for(String Key: mapname.keySet()), .remove (not in assessment), .replace (not in assessment)
- 2 weeks of Java OOP is not enough. Would have appreciated if we were given smaller scale projects to try out before embarking on such a large project like this. 

###### What did you struggle with in this project?
- When first provided with the UML diagram, I took some time to properly understand the relationship between the classes. However, I struggled more when I tried to apply the concepts of composition, inheritance, interface and abstraction itself.
- I also tried to store the students' enrolled information into a ArrayList instead of a HashMap initially but switched back to HashMap as I was most familiar with this collection which was covered more thoroughly in class.

###### What would make your experience with this assessment better?
- Initial setup was very helpful. However, I have to go through thoroughly the code-along section to make sure I properly understand before jumping into writing my codes.
- Would have appreciated more time as I did not have enough time to complete the exception handling part. Was mainly focusing on ArrayList, HashMap, OOPs over the weekend.
